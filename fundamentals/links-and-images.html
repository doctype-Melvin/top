        <p>The following contains info about the <strong>four</strong> different image formats used on the web.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>The JPG</h2>
        <img src="images/mochi.jpg" alt="a happy jpg mochi">
        <br>
        <p>This is a JPG image. JPGs are goot for photos. They don't allow for transparent pixels though.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>The GIF</h2>
        <img src="images/mochi.gif" alt="a happy gif mochi">
        <br>
        <p>This is a GIF image - the go-to option for simple animations. They're limited in terms of color palette - so better not use 'em for photos.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>The PNG</h2>
        <img src="images/mochi.png" alt="a happy png mochi">
        <br>
        <p>This is a PNG image. Use PNG for anything but photos because a PNG would be way bigger than a JPG.</p>
        <p>Icons, technical diagrams, logos etc. should be used as PNGs.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>The SVG</h2>
        <img src="images/mochi.svg" alt="a happy svg mochi">
        <br>
        <p>This is a SVG which is a vector-based graphic. It can scale up or down to any dimension without loss of quality.</p>
        <p>Responsive design is the home of the SVG.</p>
