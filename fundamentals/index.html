    <h1>I'm learning to code the Frontend!</h1>
    <p>This whole page is going to contain everything I will learn about the Frontend up until my Bootcamp starts.</p>
    <p>Some things I've <em>already</em> learned:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Shell command line: basics</li>
            <li>Git: basics</li>
            <li>HTML: basics</li>
            <li>CSS: basics</li>
            <li>JavaScript: basics</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Since my knowledge level is still that of a beginner, I want to improve as much as I can in the coming weeks and months.</p>
    <p>This page is dedicated to help me improving my skills and put them to practical use!</p>
    <p>One thing that's for sure is that I'm going to use <a href="http://www.google.com">this site</a> quite often!</p>
    <p>Let's go!</p>
    <h2>The Odin Project - Images and links</h2>
    <p>This section is about using links and images in an HTML document.</p>
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a><br>
    <a href="relative_link.html">Relative</a><br>
    <a href="Subfolder/subpage.html">Subpage</a><br>
    <img src="images/dog.jpg" alt="The dog"><br>
    <p>The anchor tag &lt;a&gt; let's us link to absolute and relative links. Absolute meaning to another domain or website</p>
    <p>Relative meaning to another page on our website. The 'href' tells the browser the destination <em>(hypertext reference)</em> </p>
    <p>We can also link images with the &lt;img&gt; tag. The references are made in the same way as with pages. </p>
    <p>This page goes a bit more into detail about <a href="links-and-images.html">images</a>.</p>
