Oct. 21 Thursday - Etch-A-Sketch
Today I've laid the RPS project aside and moved on to Etch-A-Sketch. This project will challenge 
me on a new level, I guess. Up until now I only initialized my github with the 
corresponding files. No code has been written this far.

The task for today is getting close to finishing the project.
*UPDATE*
I finally could figure out how to add color to the grid. The paintColor function
seems rather bulky but it works. I added a click eventListener that activates the
painting function. Next I'll have to work on another function which removes
the painting eventListener so that upon clicking no more divs change color. 
Another feature will be the rainbow mode which adds random colors. Finally there
needs to be an option for different opacity levels. 
Lots of work still ahead.
